   Q.1    What is software ? What is software engineering?

   Ans.-  Software is a set of instructions ,data or programs used to operate the computers and execute specific tasks.
                                                                           or   
              All the programs that run the computer are software.

            Software  Engineering---> Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining the  software.
                                                  --  It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development.
                                                  --  The result of software engineering is an effective and reliable software product.

   Q.2   Explain types of software?

   Ans.- There are three types of software-
             (i)   System software 
             (ii)  Programming software
             (iii) Application software 

            (i) System software- These software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware.
                                           - System software co-ordinates the activities and function of the hardware and software.
                                           - The OS is the best example of system software , it manages all the computer programs.

            (ii) Programming software- Computer programmers use programming software to write code.
                                                      - Programming software tools enable developers to develop, write,test and debug other software programs.
                                                      - Example of programming software includes assemblers ,compilers and interpreters.

            (iii)Application software - It is the most common type of software. Application software is a computer software package that prefers a
                                                       specific function for user.
                                                    - Example of application software includes office suites, graphics software , database and database management programs,
                                                        web browsers ,word processor, image editors etc.

  Q.3  What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC?

Ans.- SDLC stands for "Software Development Life Cycle".
        - SDLC is a collection of processes which are followed to develop a software.
        -The main aim of SDLC is to detailed plan for building, deploying,and maintaining the software.
    
         Phases of SDLC-

       1. Requirement:- The main aim of this phase is to collect the details of requirements of the customers so that, developers will clearly understand  
                                    what they are developing and how to fulfil the customers requirements.
   
       2. Analysis:-  It is the second phase of SDLC. In this phase the project team will analyze the requirements to understand what need to be
                             done to create the software solution.

       3.Design:-   It is the third phase of SDLC.In this phase the team begins to create the software architecture, design the user interface and code the software.
                           This phase provides a prototype of the final product.

       4.Implementation/Coding:- In this phase the team will write the code and create the necessary files and components to complete the project.

       5.Testing:- The testing phase is used to verify the  functionality of the system. And the team will test the software to ensure that it meets the user requirements
                          and is bug-free.This phase is key to the success of project that the software is developed properly.

      6.Maintainance:- In this phase the team also create a maintainance plan to ensure that any changes or updates to the software are properly implemented.
                                  And the team also create a backplan,and also create user feedback system. In this phase the software is properly maintained.

 Q.4  What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart?

Ans.- DFD stands for Data Flow Diagram.
         A data flow diagram is a diagram  notation used in software engineering. It depicts the flow data or information within a system (usually an information
          system). It focuses exclusively on information transfer between the parts of a system and it purposely omits any control flows, loops, or processing rules.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Q.5 What is Flow Chart ? Create a flow chart to make a addition of two numbers.

 Ans.-A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a work flow or process.It can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, 
          a step by step approach to solving a task.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Q.6 What is use case diagram? Create a use case on bill-payment on paytm.

 Ans.- A use case diagram is a way to summarize details of a system and the users within that system.It is generally shows a model scenario in which individuals
            interact with a system using a series of specialized symbols and connectors.
